# Chaos exploit for iOS 12.0 through 12.1.2 PoC & Writeup
this only works with A7-A12 devices running 12.0 - 12.1.2
- Writeup by @haxoorr (me) I made a clean writeup because the original PoC was posted as an image.
- Original PoC by @s0rrymybad
- Patched in iOS 12.1.3 (16D39)

- If you're interested in bootstrapping iOS kernel security research (including the ability to forge PACs and call arbitrary kernel functions), keep an A7-A12 research device on iOS 12.1.2 or lower.
